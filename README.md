## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You will need a Google Gemini API key to run this application.

*   **Gemini API Key**: You can get your free key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-recipe-generator.git
    cd ai-recipe-generator
    ```

2.  **Create an environment file:**
    Duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`.

    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3.  **Add your API Key:**
    Open the newly created `.env` file and replace `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"` with your actual Gemini API key.

    ```
    API_KEY="AI...your...key...here"
    ```

### Running the Application

This project is configured to run in a modern development environment that supports direct transpilation and serving of TypeScript/JSX files (e.g., Project IDX).

To run it in a standard local environment, you will need a development server that can handle this, such as Vite.

**Example using Vite:**

1.  Initialize a new Vite project with the React + TypeScript template.
2.  Copy the source files from this repository into the `src` directory of the new Vite project.
3.  Install dependencies: `npm install`.
4.  Run the dev server: `npm run dev`.
